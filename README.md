vim_tt2_embedded
================

Vim support for Template Toolkit tags embedded in other types of files, highlighting the underlying filetype as well.

Activated by _.tt_ before the file's extension â€” _thwapp.tt.html_, _bonk.tt.md_, _biff.tt.css_, and so on.

To use, drop these files under your _~/.vim/_ directory.
